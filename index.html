								<h3>Karthick Karuppiah</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/profilephoto.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>A individual , who believes that process makes more sense than the final outcome . What makes a great design in the front is the basic idea which was planted , back then when the design started evolving . Simpler the idea , better the design .  <a href="#com-mix burg">awesome work</a>.</p>
								<p>My personal belief is that design to get a final outcome from a sketch is not a successful design . Designing the process of the design and eventually landing at a end result makes it a better design . More like changing each parameter to get a optimized outcome , and that bring in my inclination towards parametric design.</p>
								<p>Parametric design is not  a separate style of design , it is just about how much exposed the parameters are and how much simple they are . Anything on the designers mind can be a parameter and the mix of parameters bring out the individualism of each designer and their style .</p>

							<h5>mixed use tower</h5>
							<h5>year 3 sem 6</h5>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/mixed use/spotlight01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This project is about bring in a vertical living space with a mix of residencial , institutional and commercial spaces . the lower sector of the building concicts the commercial floors and the higher part consists the rsidential floors . the main idea in the design is to bring a nice play of solid and voids enabling better flow of wind through the building and better lighting inside the spaces .</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/mixed use/render.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>concept</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/mixed use/concept 1.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The game of tetris forms the basis of the structure, in the game of tetris various shaped blocks are arranged in a vertical manner, which is exactly same as this design. In this design variety of functional spaces are arranged consciously in a vertical manner.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/mixed use/concept 2.jpg" alt=""/ ></span>
							<p>The game of tetris is a two dimensional game. This is used in a building three dimensionally with the help a core in the middle of the structure. This core acts as both structural and service core in the middle. The core consists of vertical transportation elements.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/mixed use/concpet 3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Then to add dynamic facade to the structure the blocks are placed 3d dimensionally using 3d-softwares with extrusions on the core. This helps the user have different spaces dynamic view from the building and a dynamic facade to the building.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/mixed use/concept 4.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The block are re-arranged with voids in between them to allow air flow through the structure. It acts as pores and it allows the constant wind flow</p>

							<h3>vertical rotating louver detail</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/mixed use/louver render.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This rotating , and movable partition wall is used to separate spaces in residences , instead of a solid wall , this help convert smaller spaces into larger spaces and can also enable or disable visual connectivity in the interior. This also enables the flow of wind and light through the wall . As every house have a few spots of receiving natural lighting , this helps them use the natural light to its fullest</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/mixed use/louver detail.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This detail is patented by the inventors Bart Van De Bult , Michiel Jacobus , Johannes Langeveld , Bryan.K , Ruggles at european patent office . This details are used only for educational purposes .</p>

								<h5>urban incubator for agriculture</h5>
								<h5>year 3 sem 5</h5>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/urban incubator/spotlight02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The word urban incubator gives hint about the characteristics of the users . The word urban gives lead about the neighborhood context and the word incubator is used in the brief so as to mention the main function of the building as well as the drive inside the users who come to building to work.</p>
								<p>The thoughts of the person who lives in a urban scenario will be to market and sell their idea in a much profitable way and to earn money for their expenditure . A person in a urban city will also have to consider their cost of living in the city . </p>
								<p>The thoughts of the person who wants to join a incubator will be to break out the normal ideas in the society and make changes and create something new . A urban incubator is place where these two meet  , where people come up with new ideas to change things and they market and sell it without getting influenced by the society , until the idea is converted into project</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/urban incubator/plan.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>concept</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/urban incubator/concept.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>form and zoning</h3>
								<p>First the site is divided into 3 parts, public semi private and private. Then it is zoned based on the privacy  . There are 3 blocks co-working , co-living and the admin block . After this the site was triangulated and the triangle represented each block . They were stacked based on the requirement chart and the FSI . At this stage the schematic floor plates were derived and based on the heights of the vertices’s of each plane the roof was formed using a NURBS curve and later patched to obtain the surface . This forms the basis of the evolution of the form of the structure </p>
								<h3>play of levels</h3>
								<p>The levels around the site is computer generated based on the proximity mapping of the zoning .The curves obtained from this coding were later patched . The curvature of this obtained surface were made into levels using contour command in rhino and for each .1M a riser was placed. According to the levels the function were also assigned . This helps remove the partition wall between spaces as the levels differentiate the spaces. This also makes the spaces interesting and the risers can be used to sit and have informal discussion spaces . The intent of the design was to bring in informal interaction spaces so the people of different category of work come together and have constructive discussions . And the levels in the site helps attain that .</p>

								<h5>shenzhen opera house</h5>
								<h5>year 3 sem 6</h5>
								<h5>competition project</h5>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/octet/spotlight03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>As an important showcase of China’s reform and opening up, Shenzhen is a vibrant, creative and modern coastal city. Boasting the core engine of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), it is visioned to be a global benchmark that excels in competition, innovation and influence by the middle of this century.</p>
								<p>The industrial age, however, brought new zoning laws and a stricter division between living and working spaces. The emergence of the car reinforced this trend, bringing with it an acceptance of traveling long distances between home, office, and shopping and an exodus from city living to suburban life.</p>
								<p>But now developers are once again embracing mixed-use development. People are returning to cities, and high-density development is trending. In addition, a relaxation in mixed-use zoning laws since the 1990s has helped to pave the way for architects and city planners to develop creative concepts that fulfill a variety of city dwellers’ needs in a single location.</p>
								<h3>Spaces</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/octet/p1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/octet/p2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/octet/p3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/octet/p4.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>There are totally 3 opera hall at various level , the one on the entrance level is easy to access and thus being the main hall  with maximum seating capacity and there are 2 other opera halls on the upper floors . </p>
								<p>The entrance of the opera house , is between 2 huge 3 dimensionally design concrete surfaces which give a new feel and make a new impression when the user is entering through .The transition from the exterior to the interior can be felt remarkably through the entrance . The materials used in this opera house is exposed concrete and glass .</p>
								<p>The entrance lobby is a very big lobby with full height spaces to give the user a grand feel inside . The lobby is also left undisturbed for public expos and events . The design also hold 2 other practice studios cafeteria private exhibition space .</p>
								<h3>concept</h3>
								<p>The theories of geometry of music is the key idea behind the design . Each musical chord is represented as a geometrical shape using the theory . Later those shapes were used to make a composition . The composition was later taken into rhino and the composition was turned into 3d without disturbing its 2d dimensional front view . This constrain help get many different forms in 3idimension and can help obtain interesting volumes. The curves were later smoothened to obtain continuous and flowing form was a iconic look .</p>

							<h5>primary school</h5>
							<h5>year 2 sem 4</h5>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/hilltop school/MIAN RENDER.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>There are totally 3 blocks where the main block consists of academic classroom , canteen and oat . The admin block for admission and the director and the chairman of the school , and the hostel block consists of the swimming pool , library and the hostel.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/hilltop school/SITE PLAN.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The red area represents the landscape . The landscape are is continuously treated as the negative space and they were designed simultaneously as the blocks were designed.</p>
							<P>The main consideration was not to remove any prep-existing softscape features and it was consciously designed to compliment the features in site. The existing tress were used for a specific function .</P>
							<h3>ZONING AND sketches</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/hilltop school/sketch.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The site is divided into public , semi-private and the private zone .The admin block is in the public for easy access  , the main block in the semi-private space and the hostel block in private zone for security of the students. This is done to separate the user of each block and to ensure the safety and security of the students .	</p>
							<h3>concept</h3>
							<p>Initially the characteristic of small kids are written down on a sheet of paper . Then these aspect of a child are abstractly sketched and they are converted into elements of the design . These elements were used to define the characteristic of the design , this makes the design more responsive to the small children .</p>
